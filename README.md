# Call of Duty - Apocalyptic Warfare
Yet another of one of my COD script. I do not provide support and you'll need to make the SQL tables yourself.

## History
Originally made for personal use but used for a community which shut down and leaked the script. I didn't bother release it then, but now I did.

## Credits and License
This is a release under the MIT License (please read LICENSE.md) and all usage of the script must be credited to the sole developer (AliLogic).

Special thanks to Gammix from whom I learnt a lot about arrays, SA-MP forum for pointing out errors in the time of development and myself for the script, anti cheat, a lot of the mapping and MyMSG module.
